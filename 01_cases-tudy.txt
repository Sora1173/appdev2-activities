Case Study #1

As an experienced professional in the software industry, you are currently employed at a company 
that has developed its own software solution, integrating various third-party software components. 
Recently, your team encountered a significant challenge with one of your third-party software providers. 
The provider notified you that they would cease support for your current implementation and required you 
to upgrade your codebase to align with their new implementation standards.

This unexpected development prompted your team to reflect on your processes and consider preventive measures 
to mitigate similar challenges in the future. While this issue primarily concerns the third-party software provider, 
it raises questions about your approach to software integration and dependency management.

For this activity, simply choose one question you wish to answer.
What initial steps could your team have taken to anticipate potential changes or discontinuation of support from third-party software providers?
How can you improve your communication and relationship with third-party software providers to stay informed about upcoming changes or updates?
In what ways can you enhance your software architecture and design to minimize dependencies on external components and facilitate easier migration when necessary?
What strategies can you implement to ensure timely updates and maintenance of your software to adapt to changes in third-party software requirements?
Reflecting on your experience, what lessons have you learned, and what actionable steps can you take to prevent similar issues in the future?

Question 1 : In what ways can you enhance your software architecture and design 
to minimize dependencies on external components and facilitate easier migration when necessary?

One of the solutions that I can think of is to create fallback plan so that we I can
handle different cases where 3rd party services become unavailable. This will enable us
to switch easily to different or alternative providers.

Another thing that I can do is use version control. With this, we can maintain different versions
and and create backups in case of 3rd party dependency problems.

The use of 3rd party software providers can be minimized but there are times that
we have to rely to such dependencies. We can also improve our system architecture by
creating layers of abstraction, we can create functions taht would isolate the processes
that involve the use of 3rd party providers. with this, we only need to update the specific function
and not the whole codebase.

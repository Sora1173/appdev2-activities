Looking back, the project could have been managed better in several ways. 
First, we should have used a stronger project management method with clear goals 
and regular progress checks to keep tasks on schedule. Using agile methods 
like Scrum or Kanban would have helped us review and adjust our work more often, 
making it easier to spot and fix delays early.
Setting aside specific time for testing in the project plan, instead of leaving it all until the end, 
would have prevented the current rush and made sure the product was more stable.
Finally, improving communication among team members could have revealed problems earlier,
allowing us to solve them quickly and adjust our plans as needed.
